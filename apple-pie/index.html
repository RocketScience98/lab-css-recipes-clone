      <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees
        C).Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
        to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.</li> 
        <li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
          slightly. 
          Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
          that it does not run off.</li> 
        <li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
          degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
